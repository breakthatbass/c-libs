# notes-py
my own personal cheatsheet `man` pages for things that I regularly forget. 

These notes are not meant to be exhaustive of all things, but instead just the things I often forget and need to use presented in a super simple way for me to copy and paste. It is probably not very useful for others.

`notes` is just a simple `python` script that reads the text file from the `pages` directory that matches the command supplied.

This is similar to [`tldr`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) but not meant to replace it. It's meant to be used alongside the Unix `man` pages and `tldr`.

## installation
for now 
```
./install.sh
```
maybe one day i'll add it to `pypi` but today ain't that day.

## usage
```
usage: notes command

use ['l', '-l', '--list', 'list'] to list all available notes
```
