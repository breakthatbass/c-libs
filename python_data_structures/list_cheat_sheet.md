## ```append()```, ```insert()```, ```extend()```  


```append()``` : add element to end of list. takes one argument  

```insert()``` : add element in specific location. takes two arguments. arg1 is an int: location of element. arg2 is element to add.  

```extend()``` : like ```append()``` but adds multiple elements at once to end. elements need to be a list. ex: ```lst.extend(['more', 'elements'])```
