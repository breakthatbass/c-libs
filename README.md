# c-libs
A collection of C libraries I've made and maintained over time.


## libs

**linked list** - a dead simple list that can act as a stack or queue with many functions.
- [docs](https://github.com/breakthatbass/c-libs/blob/master/docs/list.md)
- [src](https://github.com/breakthatbass/c-libs/blob/master/src/llist.c)

**strlib** - a handful of useful functions not contained in `string.h`.
- [docs](https://github.com/breakthatbass/c-libs/blob/master/docs/strlib.md)
- [src](https://github.com/breakthatbass/c-libs/blob/master/src/strlib.c)

**timing.h** - an insanely simple `.h` file timing lib to benchmark code quickly and easily.
- [src & docs](https://github.com/breakthatbass/c-libs/blob/master/src/timing.h)

**minunit** - my fork of the minunit unit testing library
- [my fork](https://github.com/breakthatbass/c-libs/blob/master/src/minunit.h) - prints with colors for easier reading
