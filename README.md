# ðŸ§° toolbox

**A collection of c utility libraries, notes, and scripts.**  

The [`libs`](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/libs) directory contains a collection of libraries I've made over time. Most of are tested and bug free (for now). Docs for each lib is in the `libs` directory as well as simple install scripts for generating the files in your project.

the [`notes`](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/notes) directory contains a collection of markdown files with notes and templates on certain topics and programs I regularly reference.  

The [`scripts`](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/scripts) directory contains some scripts that I wrote and find useful.

## Table of Contents

### libs
1. [timing.h](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/libs#timingh) - ultra-simple timing library contained in a small header file. Benchmark your code quickly and easily.
2. [split](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/libs#split) - split a string into an array of strings based on delimiter(s).
3. [linked list](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/libs#linked-list) - a simple linked list which acts as a template containing plenty of methods.
4. [converter](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/libs#converter) - an occasionally useful set of functions to convert between bases.
5. [minunit]() - my fork of the [minunit](https://github.com/siu/minunit) unit testing program for C programs.
6. [strlib](https://github.com/breakthatbass/toolbox/tree/master/libs#strlib) - a small string library with some useful functions not contained in `string.h`.
